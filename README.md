----------------------------------
1. A visitor goes to upload.html and fills in their recipe
2. On submit → recipe saved to browser localStorage instantly
3. Page auto-redirects to recipe.html?id=<timestamp>
4. recipe.html reads the ID from the URL, loads the recipe data,
   and renders a FULL recipe page dynamically — timer, reviews, everything
5. Back on home.html, the community recipe appears in the grid
   under a " Community Recipes" label
